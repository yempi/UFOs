# UFOs
## Overview
This project is built by request of a client that wants to catalogue UFOs sightings data previously provided. This file is in array format, we will be adding a table format and filtering the data in order to visualize in a better manner. This table will be displayed in a website.

## Results
By entering the webpage we can see the front page of the 'UFO sightings' information

By scrolling down you can find the filter section which are:

Here the information that you are looking for can be entered and the list will filter accordingly appearing on the right side of the filter table. For example, if we search for UFO sightings with a shape 'light' this will be the result:

## Summary
One drawback that can be found with this first version of the webpage can be that the filter section is not as robust as it can be, for example, if you add an extra space the key words will not give a result, or if there is someone that in state writes the full name this will not perform as is supposed to.

For further development variations of the data can be included and also in the data filter there could be search by year instead of an exact date.
